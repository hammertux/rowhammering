# How is DRAM Organised?

## Intro
Usually, DRAM is connected to the CPU through a **channel**. Modern Organisations have more channels (e.g., dual-channel). A DRAM has two "sides" known as **ranks**. The front of the DRAM is _rank-0_ and the back is _rank-1_. A DRAM contains various chips in an organisation like the following:

![DRAM Chip](https://github.com/andreadidio98/rowhammering/blob/master/DRAM%20chip.png?raw=true)

A chip is subdivided in multiple banks and each bank is subdivided in various rows. Usually each row is 8KB and stores data in bits in physical memory.

## Reading from DRAM
When the CPU wants to access a row in memory (e.g., row 1), we have to **activate the row** and the activated row is **copied to the row buffer**, then the value _from the row buffer_ is returned to the CPU. If the CPU wants to access a different row, the process starts again, _evicting_ the previous row from the row buffer. I.e., the row buffer acts like a cache for rows. If the CPU wants to access a row that is in the row buffer, we have a **row hit**, if the row is NOT in the row buffer, there is a **row conflict**.

## Refreshing the DRAM


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/andreadidio98/rowhammering/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/andreadidio98/rowhammering/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
